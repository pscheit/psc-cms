1
00:00:00,475 --> 00:00:04,995
Hey, what do you guys think of my new ducky tie?
Pretty cute, right?

2
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:08,088
And not that much more expensive
than a regular tie.

3
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:10,029
A ducky tie?

4
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:15,239
Bro, why do you do this
when you know I must slam you for it?

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,630
You guys might want to look away
'cause this ain't gonna be pretty.

6
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:20,131
You ready?

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,525
Duck, duck... gross.

8
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:27,860
Hashtag burn, hashtag duck tie slam,
hashtag Stinson rocks.

9
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:32,470
- What else is going on?
- Oh, guess who I ran into.

10
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:35,551
A girl from my past.
Any guesses?

11
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:36,697
- Stella.
- Zoe.

12
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:38,331
- Karen?
- The girl who beat you up.

13
00:00:38,332 --> 00:00:39,760
The girl who ruined
a photo with Slash!

14
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:41,350
The girl who made you
get the butterfly tattoo?

15
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:44,533
You make it sound like I've dated
a series of Stieg Larsson novels.

16
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:47,191
Perhaps I need to be a little more specific.

17
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:48,925
<i>I met this girl at a wedding.</i>

18
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:52,367
<i>We were together for a while,
but then she moved to Germany.</i>

19
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:55,623
<i>We decided to try long distance,
but it didn't work</i>

20
00:00:55,624 --> 00:00:59,884
<i>because I cheated on her with
someone at this very table.</i>

21
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:02,194
- Victoria.
- Victoria!

22
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:05,292
She catered dessert for the Architects' Ball.

23
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:07,822
Wow. I mean, what's it been,
like, what, six years?

24
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:10,923
Yeah, it's so funny how the past...

25
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:15,537
you know, you think you're doing fine,
but you know, because true love... God, Lily!

26
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:20,328
- What on Earth is going on with your cans?
- Oh, these old things?

27
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:22,250
I got my pregnancy boobs!

28
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:25,833
I'm in that sweet spot
where the chestal area knows I'm pregnant,

29
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:28,394
but hasn't told the downstairs neighbors.

30
00:01:28,395 --> 00:01:29,889
Well, what are you waiting for, Lil?

31
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,267
- Bust 'em out! Make 'em dance!
- No!

32
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:35,716
# Let your boobies show! #

33
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:39,359
Okay, I'm sorry, pal,
but the party in my wife's sweater

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,588
is a private event,
and I'm the bouncer.

35
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:43,994
Dude, I think they's the bouncers.

36
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:47,915
Okay, can we stop talking about
my wife's breasts, please?

37
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,466
Ted ran into Victoria!

38
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:53,209
I know, I'm still a little shaken by it.
I mean, there she was after all these years.

39
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,225
The emotions and memories and...

40
00:01:56,444 --> 00:02:01,054
Geez, Lily, it's like you have
a butt on your chest.

45
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:20,357
Why on Earth would I want to see that?

46
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:23,446
They're round and attached to my body.
It's an even trade.

47
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:25,257
Okay, who wants dinner?

48
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:27,584
Bless you.
Let's go to Shinjitsu.

49
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:30,601
Again? Really?
You bring that up, like, once a month.

50
00:02:30,602 --> 00:02:34,230
It's hibachi grilling with a vaudeville twist.
I mean, come on, who's in?

51
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:37,666
- No! Forget it!
- Okay, how about this:

52
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,719
if you can go ten seconds
without looking at Lily's boobs,

53
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,160
we'll go wherever you want to go.

54
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:45,896
Deal.

55
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,360
Damn it!

56
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:53,843
Oh, well.

57
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:58,927
So you saw Victoria.
You must have been freaked.

58
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:00,877
No, it was cool.

59
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:06,653
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey, kiddo.

60
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:10,844
Okay, Ted,
'cause from where I was standing...

61
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,339
Robin! Just...
Okay?

62
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:29,613
I'm telling this story.

63
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:36,394
Instead of the obligatory awkward small talk,
let me just kick this off by saying

64
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:39,399
I'm really, really sorry.

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,427
Thanks.
It's unnecessary, but thanks.

66
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:46,417
So, wasn't awkward.

67
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:48,057
- It was a little awkward.
- Not really.

68
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:50,048
It was a little awkward.

69
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:54,202
Lucky for you, the cavalry
rode in to smooth things over.

70
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:55,503
So,...

71
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:01,413
I stole your boyfriend!
That was, like, crazy!

72
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:03,486
Like, what?!

73
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:07,922
But... bridge,
water under it.

74
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:12,473
It was all Ted's fault. He got me drunk.
What? Yeah! Be right there.

75
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:16,052
Oh, guess who's here?
Robin.

76
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:20,179
I'm really happy for you guys.
You look cute together.

77
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,932
Oh, no, no, we're not together.
I mean, we-we dated for, like, a year.

78
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:26,128
But now we're just friends.

79
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:27,891
- It's not weird.
- No.

80
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:31,143
No. Why would that be weird?
I mean, if you hung out every day, that would...

81
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:32,471
We do.

82
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:34,448
...still not be weird.

83
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:36,844
I've never known anybody
that hangs out with their ex every day.

84
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:39,730
- Well, Barney does.
- Really? Who's Barney's ex-girlfriend?

85
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,031
Robin.

86
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:44,181
- Your Robin?
- Mine and Barney's, yeah.

87
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:47,874
- You don't all three hang out together?
- All the time.

88
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,825
And we have weird.

89
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:54,380
- It's not weird!
- Has anyone gotten a bite yet?

90
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:57,332
Oh, good! Here we go!
The main event.

91
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,051
Oh, we got Takumi.
He is good!

92
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:01,103
I mean, who am I kidding?
They're all amazing!

93
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:03,334
Let the dinnertainment begin!

94
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:08,680
Oh, that reminds me, there's this
other restaurant we should try sometime.

95
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:10,274
What they do is,

96
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:14,155
they cook your meal in a little
room called a "kitchen."

97
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:15,755
What's the name of that...?
Oh, yeah!

98
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:18,346
"Every Other
Restaurant In New York City."

99
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:21,927
Hashtag burn,
hashtag Your Tie Is Still Dumb,

100
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:24,137
hashtag refill!

101
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,909
- So you're talking to Victoria.
- I'm talking to Victoria.

102
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,200
Well, I should probably
get back to the bakery.

103
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,494
I'm taking a late bus out
to the Hamptons tonight,

104
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:38,230
and I've got a sink full of dishes
that my assistant did not clean.

105
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,018
Because my assistant is me.

106
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:43,438
But it was
really good seeing you, Ted.

107
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,218
- Yeah, you, too.
- Okay.

108
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:48,334
Wait.

109
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:50,720
Let me do the dishes.

110
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:54,223
- What?
- Victoria, do you believe in fate?

111
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,300
I believe you're about
to give a big speech on fate.

112
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:57,861
Well, I do.

113
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:01,823
And I think when two people like
you and me randomly bump into each other,

114
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:03,221
it means something.

115
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:05,642
I have to make amends for what I did.

116
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:09,094
Look, I can't undo what I did
six years ago, but...

117
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:10,845
I can wash dishes.

118
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:14,332
It's actually something I'm good at.

119
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:18,035
- Ted...
- I swear to you I am not trying anything.

120
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:22,005
# I said, bang, bang, bangity-bang
I said a bang, bang, bangity-bang. #

121
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,788
Guys, guys!
Shut up!

122
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:27,443
Give the artist a little respect!

123
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:32,015
Sir, I apologize for that,
and for what I'm about to say.

124
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,696
Here's my impression of this guy.

125
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:39,469
Welcome to Shinjitsu!

126
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,240
I used to be a night manager
at Dairy Queen!

127
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,056
Anyone can do that.

128
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:49,678
Oh really? Then why don't you do it, Barney?
Show us all the tricks if they're so easy.

129
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:53,286
Show us the onion volcano,
the fried rice beating heart,

130
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,831
the shrimp in the pocket.

131
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:58,460
I bet Ted showed Victoria
the shrimp in his pocket.

132
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,464
Shrimp? Really?

133
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,432
Okay, I'll do all those things.
You just name the time and the place.

134
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:06,591
- Okay, right here after we eat.
- And what do I get if I do?

135
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,533
- What do you want?
- I want to touch Lily's boobs.

136
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:09,853
Deal!

137
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,579
- Hey, sweetie?
- Yeah, I heard.

138
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:18,282
Okay, Barney, you want to make this real?
Let's make this real.

139
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:22,386
Terms: If you can do all that stuff
that Marshall just listed off,

140
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:24,098
I will let you touch one boob.

141
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:25,524
- Both boobs.
- Just one.

142
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:26,967
- Touch and squeeze.
- Just touch.

143
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,454
- Touch and motorboat.
- Just touch.

144
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:29,465
- Honka honka?
- Barney.

145
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,699
- Just touch.
- Just touch.

146
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,291
- For one hour.
- For one second.

147
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:35,059
- 20 minutes, both boobs.
- Thirty seconds, one boob.

148
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,721
- Four minutes, both boobs, three squeezes.
- One minute, both boobs, one squeeze.

149
00:07:39,722 --> 00:07:41,050
Deal!

150
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:45,355
But, if you can't do everything
and I mean everything,

151
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:49,219
then you have to wear Marshall's ducky tie...

152
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:50,786
for one year.

153
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:56,421
Deal.

154
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:04,832
- So you get to the bakery.
- We get to the bakery.

155
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,632
Well, this is great.

156
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:09,937
You know what else is getting clean
along with this cupcake tray?

157
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:11,422
My conscience.

158
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:14,985
You got anything else you need to atone for?
My oven needs cleaning.

159
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:19,762
No, nothing else.
Not yet anyway.

160
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:24,765
# Bang, bang, bangity-bang,
I said a bang-bang-bangity... #

161
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:26,188
I'm getting married.

162
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:30,699
Bang.

163
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:38,670
Baby, I think I got yours.
This one has no booze.

164
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:40,046
Oh, no, that's mine.

165
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,889
Yeah, I don't know
why people think that Mai Tais need booze.

166
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,621
I've been drinking virgins all night,
and they're delicious.

167
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:47,915
Yeah, well, enjoy your Mai Tai

168
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:52,074
because as of tomorrow night,
you'll be wearing my tie.

169
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,936
- Our future child is so lucky.
- Wait.

170
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:59,758
- You're not drunk?
- Huh. I guess not.

171
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:03,776
It's a hustle!
We gettin' hustled!

172
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:07,102
Oh, this stinks.
This stinks to holy hell!

173
00:09:07,476 --> 00:09:08,709
He's gonna win the bet!

174
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,357
Baby, come on.
Even if he was sober as a nun,

175
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:15,234
- there's no way he could do what these guys do.
- Exactly.

176
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:20,021
I mean, to learn the trademark secrets
of Shinjitsu hibachi cooking,

177
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:25,017
one would have to go all the way...
to Hoboken, New Jersey.

178
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:27,320
Yeah, they have a school there.

179
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,210
It's a six-month course.
They teach you everything.

180
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:34,111
- How do you know that?
- Maybe I looked it up on my phone just now.

181
00:09:34,112 --> 00:09:36,506
Then again, maybe not.

182
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:46,988
- So, Victoria's getting married.
- She's getting married.

183
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,857
I'm sorry. I should have
told you that way earlier.

184
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:51,495
No, no, it's fine.

185
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:54,839
- You thought something was gonna happen.
- Like one percent.

186
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,578
Maybe slap on a ring next time.

187
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:59,124
Well, the problem is,
he hasn't asked me yet.

188
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,361
I found the ring in a
box in his sock drawer.

189
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:04,754
Wow! Guy's got a whole
drawer just for socks?

190
00:10:04,755 --> 00:10:06,355
Must be nice.

191
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:12,086
- So when's Money Bags popping the question?
- I'm pretty sure tomorrow.

192
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:14,861
He's taking me out
to a really nice restaurant out in the Hamptons.

193
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:15,962
It's right on the water,

194
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:20,353
so afterwards we'll take a walk
on the beach in the moonlight.

195
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:27,286
- You should probably go.
- I don't know. It sounds pretty intimate.

196
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:31,039
I'm serious.
I feel like I misled you.

197
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,020
Madam, I came here to wash your dishes.
Nothing more.

198
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:38,557
- What was that!?
- What was what?

199
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:42,988
This guy and Barney just shared a look!
Do you know him?

200
00:10:46,703 --> 00:10:50,581
They did it again!
This whole thing stinks, I tells ya!

201
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:51,850
It stinks!

202
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,587
Lily, are you really suggesting that

203
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:58,666
Barney spent six months
commuting back and forth to Hoboken

204
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:02,332
to learn a signature cooking style
of a restaurant he doesn't even like

205
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,643
so he could win a bet
he hadn't even made yet?

206
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:09,344
- Yeah, the whole thing stinks.
- No, it's not possible, okay?

207
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:12,118
I was the one who said
let's go to Shinjitsu...

208
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:14,483
Bless you.
How could Barney have...

209
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:23,892
You brilliant bastard.
It's all so obvious now.

210
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,998
For the past, oh, I don't
know how long, five years,

211
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,312
every time I've said,
"Let's go to Shinjitsu"

212
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,618
Bless you.

213
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:33,473
You've sneezed.
Every time.

214
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,489
<i>And little by little...</i>

215
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:37,312
Let's go to Shinjitsu.

216
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,907
- Bless you.
- Bless you.

217
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:41,612
<i>...you forged the association in my brain.</i>

218
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:44,938
- So what should we do for dinner?
- Let's go to Shinjitsu.

219
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:46,526
- Oh, bless you.
- Thanks.

220
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,042
<i>Until eventually...</i>

221
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:52,236
Yes, I know I said that we'd be back Sunday,
but guess what? We are back now!

222
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:54,304
Now what on earth...
Stop bouncing!

223
00:11:54,305 --> 00:11:57,123
What on earth would make you think
that we'd be okay with this?

224
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,012
Let's go to Shinjitsu.

225
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,086
When you were sick for a week last year,
I had Shinjitsu like six times.

226
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:08,218
You had the knife skills...
you had the trigger...

227
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:11,503
All you needed then was
to want something from me.

228
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:15,494
And then one day... those
somethings came a-busting out.

229
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:22,385
I am gonna have to walk this earth,
knowing Barney has touched my boobs.

230
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:27,186
Yeah. It stays with you.
His email reminders don't help.

231
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:29,239
Okay, Lily, this is ridiculous.

232
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,867
- If you want to call the bet off...
- Great! The bet's off!

233
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,309
Let me finish.

234
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,117
Here's the deal.

235
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:38,537
If you let me just see them,
no touching, just looking,

236
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:39,783
- for one minute...
- 30 seconds.

237
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:42,203
For 30 seconds,
in a well-lit photography studio...

238
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:43,721
- In the alley.
- In the alley...

239
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:48,402
then we'll cancel this entire wager completely.
Do we have a deal?

240
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:50,373
I totally think you should take the deal.

241
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:52,961
- I don't think we have a choice.
- Go on, take the deal.

242
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:54,592
I'll... think about it.

243
00:12:57,995 --> 00:13:01,028
- So you're doing the dishes...
- I'm doing the dishes.

244
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:02,352
All done.

245
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:07,415
Congratulations.
Your karmic slate is clean and lemony fresh.

246
00:13:07,492 --> 00:13:09,487
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

247
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:15,035
See, now I can start anew,
and hopefully end up as happy as you and...

248
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:16,733
- Sorry, what's his name?
- Whose name?

249
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:19,675
- Your fiancé-to-be.
- Oh! His name is Klaus.

250
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:21,222
- Klaus.
- Klaus.

251
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:24,327
- German name.
- Yeah, German guy.

252
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:30,214
When you were living in Germany,
and we were doing the whole long-distance thing,

253
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:33,254
- wasn't there a Klaus in your class?
- There was a Klaus in my class.

254
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:35,390
- And you and Klaus were close.
- Not that close.

255
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:37,662
Yes, yes, you and the Klaus from
your class were quite close.

256
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,156
Kind of close.

257
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:41,010
- Was that your Klaus?
- My Klaus?

258
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:42,362
- In your class.
- In my class?

259
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,711
Is your Klaus the kind of
close Klaus from your class?

260
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:46,036
Yes.

261
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:52,784
- You didn't cheat on me with Klaus, did you?
- No. No, I did not.

262
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:54,156
Okay, new question.

263
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:58,667
After we broke up, how long were you single
before you and Klaus started dating?

264
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:03,183
Oh, how long... um, well,
we broke up in April, so...

265
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:04,802
a day and a half.

266
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,712
- You have got to be kidding me!
- I'm sorry.

267
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:11,715
So I've spent the last six years
feeling like

268
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:15,783
I completely betrayed you,
when in truth, you...

269
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:18,036
No, you know what?

270
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,824
Okay. Fine.
Just let yourself off the hook on a technicality!

271
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:29,073
- Forget the fact that you did cheat on me!
- Forget it?

272
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:31,291
I will never forget it.

273
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:35,050
Okay? I will never stop regretting it,
because what we had meant that much to me!

274
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:37,243
I just... I wish it had meant
something to you, too.

275
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,654
Are you kidding?

276
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,405
- I loved you!
- Did you?

277
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:42,706
Yes.

278
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,790
We had such an amazing time together.

279
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:51,239
Do you remember that night
we found that crazy videotape of Barney?

280
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,670
Game night.

281
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:55,085
We played that ridiculous game
Marshall invented.

282
00:14:55,086 --> 00:14:56,160
- Marshgammon.
- Yeah.

283
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,621
We've played it a few times since.
I still don't get it.

284
00:14:58,622 --> 00:15:01,116
Remember the night we met?

285
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:03,285
I remember you not
letting me kiss you.

286
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:06,589
- Remember why?
- You had this ridiculous idea

287
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,759
- that the moment leading up to the kiss...
- The drum roll.

288
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,975
...is as good as the kiss itself.

289
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:15,350
- Isn't it?
- Well, it's certainly more innocent.

290
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:18,394
- It's completely harmless.
- Completely.

291
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:34,804
- Oh, my God!
- Oh no. No, no-no-no-no-no.

292
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:37,568
- I should not have done that.
- No, that was me.

293
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,969
I let you come wash my dishes!
I said my "oven" needed "cleaning"!

294
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,290
I invited you into a porno!

295
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:47,066
No. You were right.
This is fate.

296
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:51,763
I needed to see you one more time
in order to know for sure about Klaus.

297
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:54,089
- And...?
- And...

298
00:15:57,496 --> 00:15:59,596
I have a bus to catch.

299
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:07,933
- Fine, you can see my boobs!
- To the alley!

300
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,484
This seems unfair.

301
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:12,874
I mean, I get that I'm the only person
not allowed to see this, but...

302
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,825
it just, it seems unfair.

303
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,618
- Come on, Lily, hurry up.
- Guys...

304
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:23,388
I'm all for honoring a
bet, but who invited Takumi?

305
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:25,587
Sorry, bro.
I tried.

306
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:27,455
<i>{/I'll send you the pictures.}</i>

307
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:33,732
What's going on? What am I missing?
Are they out yet? What do they look like?

308
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:37,285
Look, I don't want to know!
Just tell me the kind of coin.

309
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:39,226
Do you know how long 30 seconds is?

310
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:41,847
It's going to be five seconds of...

311
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,409
followed by 25 seconds of...

312
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:51,558
I mean, yes, seeing Lily's boobs
is all you've ever wanted, but come on.

313
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:55,673
All he's ever wanted...
Lily, stop!

314
00:16:56,282 --> 00:17:00,242
Don't you see?
This was his plan all along!

315
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:04,406
He let us think he knows how
to do all this Shinjitsu stuff,

316
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:08,167
just so he could get you out here
whipping out your milk-makers!

317
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:12,778
You son of a bitch!
The bet is back on!

318
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:17,075
Nice try, Barney!
Nice try.

319
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,545
Maybe I was wrong.

320
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:35,799
Well, I guess that's everything
you asked me to do, is it not?

321
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,373
Oh, wait! The shrimp in the pocket.
A modern classic.

322
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,958
And now,
for one minute on second base...

323
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:47,030
with a firm yet sensual squeeze...

324
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,156
- Nothing can stop him now.
- One thing can.

325
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:51,847
Make that two things.

326
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,358
No...!

327
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:16,432
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

328
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:22,326
- So you take her to the bus...
- I take her to the bus.

329
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:24,215
Well, this feels familiar.

330
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:27,606
You leaving, me kind of
wanting to say, "Don't go"

331
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:30,911
- Little late for that.
- Little bit.

332
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:32,562
- Don't go.
- Ted...

333
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:37,117
I'm sorry. I just...
Why didn't I say it then?

334
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:42,147
Why'd I let you get on that plane?
Why didn't I get on it with you?

335
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:45,816
What would our lives be
right now, if we had just...

336
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:47,577
held on?

337
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:53,239
Would I have still run into you at this party
tonight, or would we have been there together?

338
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,400
We'd go home...
to our home?

339
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,240
You cook.
I do the dishes.

340
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,496
I'm happy that you're happy.
But damn it.

341
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:09,127
What if?

342
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,392
Do you really want to know
the answer to that?

343
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:16,634
No.
I think it would kill me.

344
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:18,808
Good-bye, Ted.

345
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:30,893
And that was it.

346
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,839
Now she's probably engaged.

347
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:39,979
Maybe it's for the best.

348
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:44,743
All right. Well...

349
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:48,002
We're gonna duck out.

350
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:51,053
Sorry to leave you with the bill.

351
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:55,453
Oh, guys,
it's gonna be a good year.

352
00:19:56,932 --> 00:20:00,354
I'm glad you guys can laugh,
'cause I think I'm gonna be physically ill.

353
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:01,888
Coming down with a mallardy?

354
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:05,635
Oh, they look hungry. There you go.
Here you go.

355
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,662
<i>Kids, there was one part I left out.</i>

356
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:10,251
Good-bye, Ted.

357
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:14,982
Okay, yes.
What's the answer?

358
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:23,267
There is a reason that it didn't
work out between you and me,

359
00:20:23,268 --> 00:20:25,192
but it's not Germany.

360
00:20:25,193 --> 00:20:26,768
And I'm willing to bet it's the
same reason none of

361
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:30,480
your other relationships in the last
six years have lasted either.

362
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:31,781
It's Robin.

363
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:34,508
- No.
- Yes.

364
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:38,172
She is so much bigger
in your world than you realize.

365
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:41,886
And this thing that you're all doing,
you and Barney and Robin,

366
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,915
where the three of you hang out
at the bar night in, night out,

367
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,716
like you're all just buddies?

368
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:51,484
- That doesn't work. Trust me.
- You-You've got it all wrong.

369
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:53,295
I'm right about this.

370
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:56,919
Good-bye, Ted.

371
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:02,927
<i>And sure enough, she was right.</i>

372
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:07,817
<i>It didn't work.
We just didn't realize it yet.</i>

373
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:10,318
