Migration to 1.7
====================

## Major changes

Uses Webforge 1.8.

This is an maintenance release. A lot of old classes have been removed. Thats why the patch version was increased (just in case). If you have a running 1.6 migration this has a good chance to work out of the box.

- supports PHP 5.5
